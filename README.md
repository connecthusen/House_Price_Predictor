# üè° House Price Prediction using XGBoost

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
This project predicts **house prices** based on multiple property features using **XGBoost regression**. Users can input house details and get an **estimated price** in real-time. The model is trained on the **Ames Housing dataset**, which contains detailed information about residential homes.

**Goal:** Build a predictive model that accurately estimates the selling price of a house using relevant property features.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset

- **Source:** [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)  
- **Number of records:** 2,930+ rows (houses)  
- **Features:** 14 features selected based on correlation with house price  

### Features Used

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Gr Liv Area` | Above ground living area (in sq ft) |
| `Bedroom AbvGr` | Number of bedrooms above ground |
| `Full Bath` | Number of full bathrooms |
| `Half Bath` | Number of half bathrooms |
| `Garage Cars` | Garage capacity (number of cars) |
| `Year Built` | Year the house was built |
| `Lot Area` | Total lot size (in sq ft) |
| `Overall Qual` | Overall material and finish quality (1‚Äì10) |
| `Overall Cond` | Overall condition rating (1‚Äì10) |
| `Total Bsmt SF` | Total basement area (in sq ft) |
| `Garage Area` | Garage area (in sq ft) |
| `1st Flr SF` | First floor area (in sq ft) |
| `2nd Flr SF` | Second floor area (in sq ft) |
| `Fireplaces` | Number of fireplaces |

> These features were chosen because they strongly influence house prices in the dataset.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Values:**  
  - Replaced missing numeric values in features with `0`.  
  - Replaced missing target values (`SalePrice`) with the **median** of the column.
- **Scaling:**  
  - Used **StandardScaler** to scale feature values so that the model converges faster and predictions are more accurate.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

- **Model Used:** `XGBRegressor` from XGBoost library  
- **Hyperparameters:**
  - `n_estimators=500` ‚Äì Number of trees
  - `learning_rate=0.05` ‚Äì Step size shrinkage
  - `max_depth=6` ‚Äì Maximum depth of a tree
  - `random_state=42` ‚Äì For reproducibility
  - `n_jobs=-1` ‚Äì Use all CPU cores  

**Training Steps:**
1. Split dataset into **train** (80%) and **test** (20%).  
2. Scale features using `StandardScaler`.  
3. Train the XGBoost model on scaled training data.  
4. Evaluate on test data using **RMSE** and **R¬≤ Score**.  

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures prediction error in USD.  
- **R¬≤ Score:** Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.  

Sample output after training:

üéØ Training Complete
RMSE: 24567.89
R¬≤ Score: 0.92
‚úÖ Model and scaler saved!


> High R¬≤ indicates the model fits the data well.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model & Scaler

- **house_price_model.pkl** ‚Äì Trained XGBoost model  
- **scaler.pkl** ‚Äì StandardScaler to scale user inputs before prediction  

> Both files are required for running the interactive prediction app.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Gradio Web App

The app allows users to input property features and predicts the house price.

**Steps to Use:**

1. Ensure `house_price_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` are in the same folder.  
2. Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
Open the local Gradio URL in your browser.

Enter house details and click Predict Price.

Get the estimated price instantly.
